This repo contains a set of procedure to calculate maximum
growth rate of a few plasma instabilities in given plasmas.

to_dimensionless.py:
	process in-situ data and make necessary simplications.
	save the data in an npz file.

find_start_freq:
	make preparation for k-space search by following an
	interested wave mode from known plasma along some
	path in phase space till parameters are adjusted to
	that in the interested plasmas. return a frequency
	for a specified wavenumber.

kspace_search:
	search wavenumber vector space for the maximum growth
	rate.

N.B. 
     1, to_dimensionless.py is taylored for my input data so you
     need to adapt it to your input.
     2, find_start_freq.py relies on vlasov_solver package, which
     can be found here
          https://github.com/YuguangTong/vlasov_solver
     3, numpy and scipy are necessary.
